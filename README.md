TouchOSC-Controllers
====================

These are TouchOSC controllers you can use with Traktor and Ableton that I have been creating for my personal use.


This is a TouchOSC template for the iPad that allows you to control 12 different effets in Traktor and set/delete 
5 cuepoints per deck. I created it to compliment the physical controller I currently have which is the Numark MixtrackPRO.
